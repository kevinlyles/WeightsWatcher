Weighted total of a character's gear (like GearScore), but using the default weights for that class/spec
	add option to use an alternate weight instead/in addition to the default
	default here is from ww_defaultVars, NOT just the weight with the default's name in ww_vars

import/export from/to wowhead weights

automatic outfit creation using outfitter (and others?)
	look into supporting just the equipment manger if possible
	needs to handle hit/expertise/def/etc caps intelligently

option to consider enchants when comparing gear

better user interaction re: unhandled gems, major errors, etc

(easily) customized orders for weights and maybe classes

suggestions welcome!
