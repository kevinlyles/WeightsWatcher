translation instructions:
	minimum:
		stats.lua
		base.lua
		gems.lua
		patterns-base.lua
		patterns.lua
			NOTE: you can safely skip those patterns whose section table only includes cooldownUseEffects and/or stackingEquipEffects (or any other of the recommended and later files you're skipping)
		classes-specs.lua
		slots.lua
		dropdown-options.lua
		<locale name>.xml (which will include all the other localization files)
	recommended (in recommended order of completion):
		patterns-equip-stats.lua
		patterns-elixirs.lua
		patterns-use-effects.lua
		patterns-food.lua
		patterns-enchants.lua
		patterns-fishing.lua
	"extra" features (the UI will change if these are not done, but everything else should still work):
		patterns-cooldown-use-effects.lua
		patterns-stacking-equip-effects.lua

Notes:
	You must keep the names of all non-local variables/functions the same
	All files should be saved in UTF-8 format
	Most quoted strings that are not part of ww_localization ('L' in most files) are actually lua patterns.  These are similar to regular expressions, but vary in several important ways.  See http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1 for more information about patterns.
		A few specific notes:
			to include a literal dash ('-') in a pattern, you must use "%-" or the pattern will not match
				parentheses and periods are the same way
	If you encounter a lua error, PLEASE let me know!  I have only one other language to test with, and I may have missed something.

add bit about tekerr and tekkompare
add bit about not splitting your regexes too soon
add bit about triggerGroups being special
note about localization.lua and enabling errors
add notes about itemscanner to localization info
	also notes about what is and is not localized in which part of the addon
note about making unspecified stats melee (WeightsWatcher.lua converts them to ranged as needed)
